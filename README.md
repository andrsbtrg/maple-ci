## Automate your model Quality Check with Speckle and Maple

[Maple](https://github.com/andrsbtrg/mapple) is a library designed to write simple code that can check different attributes of a Model in Speckle.

Using Maple you can write `test specs` that check any parameter or quantity inside the project model.

`Maple` can be integrated into [Speckle Automate]() to run the quality check tests on a continuous integration and ensure project standards.

This is a Speckle Automate functions written in python
using the [specklepy](https://pypi.org/project/specklepy/) SDK to interact with Speckle data.
